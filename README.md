## Outline

While DC rental market has grown over the past decade , the number of lower-cost market units [[1]](http://apps.urban.org/features/OurChangingCity/housing/) has fallen and higher rent units now form a greater share of rentals. Additionally, Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) has projected [[2]](https://www.mwcog.org/newsroom/2018/09/12/new-cog-analysis-recommends-increase-in-area-housing-production/) a housing shortfall in the region due to employment growth currently outpacing housing growth. In the same period, the DC metropolitan area has seen a spurt in home-sharing platforms [[3]](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/19/10/p14550125/dc-short-term-rental-laws-whats-changing-in-october-2019-nomadic-real-estate). The study analyzes the correlation between the shrinking lower cost rental pool and the growth in popularity of short term rentals. It also recommends policy action to restrict and regulate home sharing platforms in the interest of DC renters. 

     
## Current Policy:

Home-sharing platforms, such as Airbnb and VRBO (Vacation Rental By Owner), have dramatically increased in popularity over the past ten years. In high cost-of-living urban areas like Washington DC, lawmakers have argued that short term rental platforms like Airbnb absorb inventory that would otherwise be available for traditional 12-month leases. In major cities throughout the US, local lawmakers have started to take action [[4]](https://www.2ndaddress.com/research/short-term-rental-laws/) to limit the impact of home-sharing on the local housing market. 

In 2018, the Bill "The Short-Term Rental Regulation Act of 2018" was passed by the DC Council, which was set to be effective from Oct 1st, 2019. This bill is stricter than previous regulations in terms of regulating properties home-owners can list of these platforms and the duration. However, the regulation is still in grey zone as it is under consideration by the DC Zoning Commission which will hold a hearing on the proposed changes soon. 

          
## Analyses and Key Findings: 
 
Home sharing platforms have been active in DC since 2008, Airbnb the largest among them with more than 9,000 listings [[5]](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb) as of August 2019. Since entering DC home-sharing market in 2008, Airbnb has seen tremendous growth in uptake by DC residents. The number of listings and hosts, the individuals who list their properties on these platforms, are still increasing although at a decreasing rate.

As we analyze the trend of listings and hosts since 2008, figure 1 shows that the number of unique hosts added per year to the platform peaked earlier than the number of unique listings added to airbnb per year. In addition to this, in fig 2 which analyzes Airbnb listing types, we see that listings of the type 'whole house/Apt' predominate. This indicates that in comparison to new members joining the platform, existing hosts are more likely to list more properties on Airbnb.

The analysis indicates that more homeowners are listing properties in addition to or besides their primary residences on this platform, proving that Airbnb has become an alternative to traditional 12-month leases for homeowners. It also validates the contention of lawmakers that platforms like Airbnb are likely absorbing properties that in normal course would have entered the rental market, thereby restricting housing supply and causing rental prices to increase.  The question also arises whether this trend has affected rental prices in DC adversely. Fig 3 plotting the trend of mean monthly rental prices since 2008 from Zillow [[6]](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) indicates that over the period that airbnb listings have grown in DC, rental prices have also risen.

While rental market is affected by a host of factors like migration to and from the city, housing market trends, property development market among others, there is no denying that home sharing platforms do play a role in affecting the pool of long term rentals. There are a host of factors that make short term rentals more attractive to homeowners than long term rentals like bigger profit margins due to higher daily rates and lower maintenance costs besides lesser regulation and oversight.  
 
 
## Recommendations:  
 
Based on the insights derived from the analyses of the listing data the following recommendations aim to regulate the short term rental market by encouraging the use of primary residence for home-sharing while limiting use of surplus properties towards long term rentals. These are: 
1. Restrict use of homes surplus to primary residence for short-term rentals:  
> - As evidenced by fig 1, hosts on Airbnb like platforms are more likely to list additional properties on the platform after the first one. Therefore, this regulation will stem this trend. 
2. Relaxing the cap on the number of days a primary residence can be listed: 
> - The current cap of 90 days a year one of the strictest in the country [[7]](https://www.2ndaddress.com/research/short-term-rental-laws/). A higher cap of 120 days or more will be friendly to the homeowners and tourists, as well bring tax income.
